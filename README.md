The XGBoost implementation in Python were part of my Master's thesis in Digital Health, which explored the use of sensor data visualisations to assist healthcare professionals in caring for people with dementia, mainly through remote monitoring. The implementation was based on a dataset collected from volunteer participants at the University of Malta, performing activities of daily living under controlled conditions. The machine learning aspect of the model aimed to further improve the collected dataset, so that false positives could be more easily detected, thus improving the chances of finding a real fall among people with dementia.
