The XGBoost implementation in Python were part of my master's dissertation in digital health, investigating the use of sensor data visualisations to aid healthcare professionals to care for people with dementia, mainly by remote monitoring
falls amongst them.
The implementation were based on a dataset collected from voluntary participants at the University of Malta, performing Activities of Daily Living under controlled circumstances.
The Machine Learning model aspect aimed to further better the dataset collected to allow for false positives to be more easily recognized, hence improving the chance of finding a real fall amongst the people with dementia.
